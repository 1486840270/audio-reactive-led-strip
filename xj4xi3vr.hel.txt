Major refactoring and changes (not stable)

Start of a major refactoring effort. Scroll effect is currently broken
by these changes.

- Removed melbank.py and replaced the filter bank generation with a
better version inside dsp.py. Implemented memoizing.

- Major restructuring of visualization.py. These changes are only the
start of a much larger refactoring effort.

- Recalculated all ExpFilter time constants. The time constants are now
independent of the frame rate. This is a very important change and
should have been done ages ago.

- Changed the way that rolling audio windows are constructed. Removed
the option to configure these settings because it won't need to be
changed.

- Applied a rainbow color map to the spectrum effect to make it more
colorful. Improvement was based on feedback in
